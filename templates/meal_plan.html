        <h1>How to Build a Meal Plan based on your Weights</h1>
        <br>Meal plans are essential to any healthy diet, although sometimes it can be hard to know just how to plan balanced meals every day.
        <br><br>But don't worry, we've got you.
        <br><br>Herbalife Nutrition dietitians have created easy and effective meal plans that have built-in calorie counts and additional tools to help you plan your meals. They are designed to provide you with the protein your body needs every day to function at its best.
        <br><br>Just follow these simple steps:
        <br>
        <br><h2>Step 1: Meal Plan Selection Tool</h2>
        No two people are alike, and everyone's protein and calorie needs vary. So how do you know which meal plan is right for you? Start with the Meal Plan Selection Tool. The charts will help you determine the suggested meal plan for you, and your plan is designed to match your individual needs for protein and calories.
        
        <br><br>The Meal Plan Selection Tool will guide you to the recommended Meal Plan A, B, C or D, based on your gender, weight and height.
        
        <br><br>You can find your recommended plan using our digital <a href = "https://iamherbalifenutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-much-protein-do-you-need-meal-chart.pdf">Meal Plan Selection Tool.</a>
        
        <br><br>Once you know which plan is recommended for you, you'll go to Step 2 to see your suggested plan based on your goals.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Step 2: Meal Plans A, B, C and D</h2>
        Each meal plan has three options:
        <br>
        <ol>
          &nbsp;<li style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily nutrition (or weight maintenance)</li>
          <li style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Weight loss</li>
          <li style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Weight gain</li>
        </ol>
        <br>Choose the option within the plan that best suits your personal goals. You can download the <a href = "https://iamherbalifenutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Herbalife-Meal-Plans-English.pdf">Meal Plan Chart here.</a>
        <br>
        <br>The Meal Plan Chart shows you what a typical day will look like, with recommended meals, snacks and shakes to choose from each day. 
        <br><br> Plans are created by choosing items from the following categories:
        <ul>
            &nbsp;<li style="line-height: 1.5;">Balanced Meals (25 grams protein, 400 calories or 40 grams protein, 600 calories)</li>
            <li style="line-height: 1.5;">Protein Snacks (10-30 grams protein, 150-300 calories)</li>
            <li style="line-height: 1.5;">Herbalife Nutrition Formula 1 Shakes (20-30 g protein, 250-300 calories)</li>
            <li style="line-height: 1.5;">Daily Nutrition (Weight Maintenance)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>When coupled with an appropriate exercise program, this option replaces one meal per day (typically breakfast) with a shake.
        <br>
        <br><p><b>Weight Loss</b></p>
        <br>This option promotes weight and fat loss when coupled with an appropriate exercise program and replaces two meals per day (typically lunch and dinner) with a shake.
        <br>
        <br><p><b>Weight Gain</b></p>
        <br>Using this option, get more protein and calories by supplementing a healthy diet with up to three Herbalife Nutrition Formula 1 shakes per day. When coupled with an appropriate exercise program, gain healthy weight (as lean body mass).
        <br>
        <br><h2>Step 3: Meal Builder Tool</h2>
        The Meal Builder tool is a simple, step-by-step approach to putting together healthy meals. Meals are made up of foods from five categories: Protein, Vegetables, Healthy Carbohydrates, Healthy Fats, and Seasonings.

        <br><br>Depending on your Meal Plan, you will create meals that have either approximately 25 grams of protein and 400 calories, or 40 grams of protein and 600 calories. Using the Meal Builder, you can select the exact foods you need to create your healthy, balanced meals.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>There are two Meal Builders: one that incorporates meat and one that is vegetarian. Choose the meal builder that works for you.</li><br>
          <li>Choose the column that corresponds to the meal you are going to build (25 grams of protein and 400 calories, or 40 grams of protein and 600 calories)</li><br>
          <li>Select the amounts of food that are listed in each food group and combine items in a variety of ways to create healthy, balanced meals.</li>
        </ul>
